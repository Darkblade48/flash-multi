IMPORTANT:
The Flash Multi installer only installs USB and DFU mode drivers for the native 'Maple' serial port (if they are selected).

If your version of Windows requires additional serial port drivers for your Multiprotocol module you will need to install those manually.

See the Flash Multi documentation for more information:
